In this, we are trying to get the RGB colour code from the Hex code. We are using Golang and exposing an HTTP endpoint (/convert/<hex-value>) which gives your RGB code for that hex code.

In our code, we are using gin-gonic Go library for exposing HTTP endpoint (a light-weight webserver) and go-playground/colors for color conversion. We are also logging our requests into a logfile for debugging or pushing logs to any APM or monitoring server.

We are dockerizing our entire application which means our application is self-contained and is of OS-agnostic (as long as OS is capable of running containers) and further we can orchestrate our application using any container orchestrator like Docker Swarm or Kubernetes which ensures application scalability.

How to run:
$ bash run.sh

* Above script will build the docker image
* Spin a container from that docker image
* Send few curl requests to the endpoint (http://localhost:8080/convert/<HEX-CODE>
